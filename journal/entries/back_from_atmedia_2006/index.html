					<h1>Back from @media 2006</h1>
					<p><img src="http://www.liptrot.org/images/uploads/atmedia_dan.jpg" alt="Dan Cederholm" width="230" height="131" class="illus" />I think <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/bollocks/">Patrick</a> has put himself in a bit of a tight spot. Looking at my bookshelf I can see at least 6 books authored by people who presented this year. Making next year's conference as good as this year's is going to be a real challenge.
It was really great to see some familiar faces among the crowd and get to meet a bunch of new ones. The conference was split along two tracks which caused a good few people to wish they could split themselves in half and it meant some really tough decisions - how do you decide between <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk">Andy Clarke</a> and <a href="http://www.tantek.com/" title="Tantek Celik">Tantek</a>?</p>
<p>Anyway here are my best bits:</p>
<p>The WCAG panel encouraging people to actually read the 2.0 draft before making their mind up (and finding out about the quick references they've just put out); though most people agreed having <a href="http://joeclark.org/">Joe Clark</a> there would have made it more of a debate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/">Jeff Veen</a>'s 'Next Generation of Web Apps' presentation was the highlight of the whole conference and a great way to finish off day 1. I've always wanted to see Jeff speak as it was his <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723700/qid=1150712536/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/203-0199538-5094339" title="Art and Science of Web Design">book</a> which gave me a huge leg-up in web design and he didn't disappoint, giving an inspiring look at the state of the industry, how far we've come and where we might be going next.</p>
<p>The social calendar sprang back into action with Patrick managing to convince the bar to open up for football and after a win and a few drinks it was down to the Texas Embassy for food with <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/" title="Gareth Rushgrove">Gareth</a> and <a href="http://thinkdrastic.net/" title="Olly Hodgson">Olly</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.simplebits.com/" title="Simplebits">Dan Cederholm</a> kicked of day 2 with a look into making sites bulletproof with examples from his <a href="http://corkd.com/" title="Social wine">Cork'd</a> site and re-energised everyone after the excesses of the night before.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/">Cameron Moll</a> told us how to look towards providing content to mobile devices and gave everyone some really useful tips to go away with.
Yahoo!'s <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">Nate Koechley</a>'s look at how they implemented standards into 3 of their upcoming products shows us how far the community has come in the past couple of years. Chatting to him afterwards about microformats and social tagging, he came across as a really nice guy.</p>
<p>Speaking of microformats, Tantek Celik enthused the whole lot of us with a run-down of what they are and the potential of them - along with examples of them out in the wild.</p>
<p>The final session was a great light-hearted 'hot topics' panel most ably hosted by <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/" title="Adactio">Jeremy Keith</a> - a great way to round of the day, followed by beer in the pub (<a href="http://www.webexposia.com" title="Webexposia">CJ</a> - are you going to start importing UK beer to Canada?).</p>
<p>What I noticed this year was a move towards more strategic thinking rather than nuts and bolts stuff. Also the presentations were without an exception amazing - from the crafted slides to the practiced speakers - coupled with a great venue this was a top class event. Congrats to Patrick and here's to @media 2007.</p>
